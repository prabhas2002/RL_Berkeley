Assignments for [Berkeley CS 285: Deep Reinforcement Learning, Decision Making, and Control](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/).

Hi, This repository is an unofficial Pytorch implemenation for CS285 Deep RL course assigments. However due to constraint in time and resources I am not able to run the code for complete results, but as far I believe , the code should work fine.

Completed 1,2 Homework assignments. (not implemented GAE in hw2)
